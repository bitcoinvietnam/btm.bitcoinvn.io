Italiani’s has been operating in Vietnam since 2016, offering wood-fired pizza, Italian staples, and Western comfort food. The restaurant attracts a broad mix of Vietnamese locals, expats, and visitors, making it a consistent and well-known dining spot in Ho Chi Minh City.

BitcoinVN has partnered with Italiani’s since 2017, beginning with the Hàn Thuyên location. This long-standing collaboration reflects a shared focus on reliability, accessibility, and serving the local community.

Italiani’s has since expanded to a new location in Bến Thành, District 1, bringing its total number of Ho Chi Minh City locations to four.

To mark the opening of the Bến Thành location at 46 Nguyễn Thái Bình, a new flagship BitcoinVN BTM has been installed on site. The machine features a Pac-Man–inspired Bitcoin design, referencing a common theme in Bitcoin culture that emphasizes the transition toward sound, hard money.

The BTM is designed for speed and ease of use, with fast note validation and dispensing to support efficient Bitcoin buy and sell transactions.
