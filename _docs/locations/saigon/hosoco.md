Hosoco is a software engineering firm that provides startups with different services to accelerate their software development division. Their direct, dutch approach allows them to take on big projects with a fraction of the staff required of handling large projects, but small enough to care.

Hosoco was founded by Robin Westerik in 2021. His foray into Vietnam started by working with autonomous water quality measuring drone as part of a research project.

Since then, he fell in love with the country and has carved out his expertise- focusing on product engineering and offshoring services to help small dutch software companies acquire talent in Vietnam.
