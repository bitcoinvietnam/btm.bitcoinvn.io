title: Do BTM require verification or KYC?
order: 5
---

[BitcoinVN](https://bitcoinvn.io/en), as the operator of the BTMs, does not require any verification or KYC on transactions 
executed via a BTM. 

A mobile number is required to make sell transactions on our BTMs. It allows customers to receive the SMS OTP. 

* Note that Viettel is the only telecom service provider in Vietnam that will send a SMS OTP. If you are using a Vietnamese number that is not with Viettel, please contact our team to help you with your transaction. 
    
    All other international numbers are able to receive the SMS OTP.

Although we recommend using your personal mobile phone, the BTM would also work with an anonymous phone number like 
the ones offered by [ReceiveSMS](https://receive-smss.com).
