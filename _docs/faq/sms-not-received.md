title: I can't receive the verification SMS?
order: 11

Currently, the only Vietnamese network operator that is able to send our SMS OTP is Viettel. If you don't have access to a Viettel number you can:

1. Use a foreign non-Vietnamese number
2. Contact the number shown on the BTM. We can use internal methods to communicate the OTP to you.
