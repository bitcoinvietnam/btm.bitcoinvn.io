BitcoinVN has been dilligently working on our inhouse develped BTMs- Visindi. With Visindi, we ask for no KYC information, only for a phone number to send an OTP.  

* Note that Viettel is the only Vietnamese telecom service provider that will send a SMS OTP. If you are using a Vietnamese number that is not with Viettel, please contact our team to help you with your transaction. 
    
    All other international numbers are able to receive the SMS OTP. 

**Visnidi**

At the BTM, press 'Sell Bitcoin'. Enter your phone number to receive an SMS OTP. Once you have input the OTP, press the amount of VND you want to recieve. The BTM only uses 500,000 VND notes. 

Press 'Cash Out', a QR Code address will display on the screen. From your Bitcoin mobile wallet app, scan and send the designtated amount of Bitcoin. Once what you have sent is confirmed 1 time on the bitcoin blockchain, you will recieve an SMS stating that your cash is ready. 

Press 'redeem' at the BTM, enter your phone number and OTP you recieved, your cash will dispense.
