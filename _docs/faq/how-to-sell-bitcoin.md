We currently operate 2 different BTM systems- Visindi and BitAccess

Visnidi

At the BTM, press 'Sell Bitcoin'. Enter your phone number to recieve an SMS OTP. Once you have input the OTP, press the amount of VND you want to recieve. The BTM only uses 500,000 VND notes. 

Press 'Cash Out', a QR Code address will display on the screen. From your Bitcoin wallet app, scan and send the designtated amount of Bitcoin. Once what you have sent is confirmed 1 time on the bitcoin blockchain, you will recieve an SMS stating that your cash is ready. 

Press 'redeem' at the BTM, enter your phone number and OTP you recieved, your cash will dispense. 

BitAccess

There are 2 ways to sell with BitAccess. Option 1 is you visit [this site](https://bitaccessbtm.com/locations/Vietnam)
and send your crypto on the website. Then you will receive an SMS stating that the cash is ready to collect. Return to the BTM, you enter your phone number and receive the cash. This option is quicker because you pre-sell 
the crypto.

Option 2- Go to the BTM, enter your phone number, send crypto to the QR code shown on the screen, wait for 1 confirmations on the blockchain, receive an SMS saying that the cash is ready for collection. Enter your phone number on the BTM and receive the cash.
