We currently operate 2 different BTM systems- Visindi and BitAccess

Visindi

At the BTM, press 'Buy Bitcoin'. With the mobile wallet address showing on your phone screen, place your phone around 15cm away from the camera and move towards the camera. Once it scans, insert the amount of Vietnamese Dong you want to send and press 'Send Bitcoin'.


BitAccess

At the BTM, press start and enter your phone number, there will be a desginated PIN you will need to create and remember. 

Press 'Buy Bitcoin' and scan your mobile wallet QR Code by placeing it over the camera.

Insert the amount of Vietnamese Dong you want to send and press 'Finish'. 

The process usually takes around 10 minutes, but it can take longer if there is traffic on the bitcoin blockchain.
