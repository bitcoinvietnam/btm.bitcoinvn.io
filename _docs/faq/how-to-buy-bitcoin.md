BitcoinVN has been dilligently working on our inhouse develped BTMs- Visindi. With Visindi, there is no KYC needed to buy bitcoin. 

**Visindi**

At the BTM, press 'Buy Bitcoin'. 

Display your mobile wallet QR code on your phone screen and place your phone around 15cm away from the camera and move towards the camera. 

Once it scans, insert the amount of Vietnamese Dong you want to purchase and press 'Send Bitcoin'.

The process usually takes around 10 minutes, but it can take longer if there is traffic on the bitcoin blockchain.
